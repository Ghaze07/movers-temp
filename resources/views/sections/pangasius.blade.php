                        <h2>Pangasius Fish</h2>
                        <p><em>Pangasius</em> is a boneless prime fish and due to its high consumption and demand, the fish suppliers in Pakistan are importing it from Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. Since January 2019, we are importing the Pangasius Fish Seed from Thailand and successfully cultured hormone free naturally raised (organic) high quality fish.</p>
                        <p>The fish (Pangasius) is really good in taste and its meat can be used in making <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fish Fingers</span> and famous <span class="font-italic">Japanese</span> recipe <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sushi</span>. You can cook it the way you like following the traditional fish recipes, grill or bake it to get maximum of its nutritional value.</p>
